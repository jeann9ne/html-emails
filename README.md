# html-emails

Why is coding HTML for Email different from web coding?
Because of the lack of support for overall styling and because we need to use inline styling to override mail client defaults.
Emails use nested tables and go against the grain of what we've learned so far coding webpages, but they do have similarities. 

What concepts help coders work around the limitations of HTML in Emails?
Inline styling and nested tables give us the ability to work with HMTL in Emails across the hundreds of possible clients.
